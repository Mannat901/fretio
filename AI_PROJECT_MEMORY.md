## üß© Project Overview
**Project Name**: Fretio  
**Description**: A student-focused marketplace platform for university communities to buy, sell, and trade items  
**Tech Stack**: 
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
- UI Components: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- State Management: TanStack Query + React Context
- SMS Integration: Twilio for phone verification

**Repository**: https://github.com/Mayanks584/fretio.git

## üîß Current Issues Fixed
**Profile Completion Flow**:
- Fixed "null value in column 'id'" error by adding id field to profile insert
- Auto-verifying profiles after document upload (for development)
- Users are marked as verified immediately to access all features
- Note: In production, admin verification would be required

```bash
npm install  # Installs all packages from package.json
```

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
VITE_SMS_PROVIDER=mock  # For development
```

**Development Commands**:
```bash
npm run dev     # Start dev server (port 8080)
npm run build   # Build for production

## ‚úÖ Progress Log
**2025-01-16 13:20 UTC** - Repository rolled back to commit 4b75490:
- Clean state after adding SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- White screen issue fixed with placeholder Supabase credentials
- Base UI working properly
- Previous work on category links and profile completion was stashed

**2025-01-16 15:22 UTC** - Fixed email verification login issue:
- Created AuthCallback.tsx page to handle email confirmation
- Added /auth/callback route to handle Supabase redirects
- Updated signup redirect URL to point to callback page
- Now after clicking verification link, users will be properly authenticated

**2025-01-16 15:29 UTC** - Fixed university and hostel dropdowns:
- Added 20 Punjab universities as static data in CompleteProfile component
- Added 12 sample hostel names for testing
- Modified useEffect to use static data instead of database fetch
- Updated handleProfileUpdate to exclude university/hostel IDs from database update
- Selected values are stored in localStorage for display purposes

**2025-01-16 15:33 UTC** - Fixed profile update error:
- Simplified handleProfileUpdate to skip database operations entirely
- Profile data now saved only to localStorage for testing
- Added validation for required fields before proceeding
- Document upload also simplified to skip actual file upload
- Both steps now work in test mode without database dependencies

**2025-01-16 17:48 UTC** - Restored Supabase database integration:
- Removed localStorage usage from CompleteProfile.tsx
- Reverted to actual Supabase database operations for profile updates
- Created SQL scripts for profiles table and storage bucket setup
- Fixed "table 'public.profiles' not found" error by ensuring table exists
- Set up verification-docs storage bucket with proper RLS policies
- Document uploads now use Supabase storage instead of localStorage
- Created user_verifications table for tracking document verification status
- Profile completion now properly saves to database with null university/hostel IDs

**2025-01-16 18:30 UTC** - Fixed email verification issue:
- Production Supabase email service was not sending verification emails
- Added temporary workaround in AuthContext.tsx to auto-sign in users after signup
- This bypasses email verification requirement during development
- Users are now automatically logged in after creating an account
- Note: For production, configure proper SMTP or use Supabase email service with higher limits

## üîß Current Focus / Active Task
**Working Branch**: `fix-category-links`  
**Current Status**: Profile completion fully integrated with Supabase database and storage  
**Active Task**: Profile data saves to database, documents upload to storage bucket

## üöÄ Next Steps
1. **Fix category navigation**:
   - Make category cards clickable in CategoryGrid component
   - Add navigation to marketplace with category filter
   - Test category filtering in marketplace

2. **Complete profile flow**:
   - Fix university/hostel dropdowns
   - Handle profile completion without database errors
   - Ensure proper navigation after profile completion

3. **Database setup**:
   - Configure real Supabase instance
   - Run SQL scripts in `supabase/` directory
   - Update environment variables with real credentials

## üí° AI Continuation Guide
To continue development on this project:

1. **Read this file first** for complete context
2. **Check current branch**: `git branch` (should be on `fix-category-links`)
3. **Start dev server**: `npm run dev`
4. **Current issues to fix**:
   - Category cards in homepage don't navigate anywhere
   - Profile completion needs proper handling without database
   - University/hostel dropdowns need to be populated

**Important Notes**:
- The app now uses local Supabase instance (started with `npx supabase start`)
- SMS provider is set to "mock" for development
- Profiles table exists with proper RLS policies
- Storage bucket 'verification-docs' configured for document uploads
- University/hostel foreign keys set to null until proper seeding is done

## üóæ Last Updated
**Date**: 2025-01-16 17:53 UTC
