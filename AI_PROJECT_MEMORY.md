## üß© Project Overview
**Project Name**: Fretio  
**Description**: A student-focused marketplace platform for university communities to buy, sell, and trade items

- Updated handleProfileUpdate to exclude university/hostel IDs from database update
- Selected values are stored in localStorage for display purposes

- Simplified handleProfileUpdate to skip database operations entirely
- Profile data now saved only to localStorage for testing
- Added validation for required fields before proceeding
